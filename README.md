Meets Specifications
Congratulations
This is brilliant work. Thanks for your patience and diligence while we are reviewing your submission.

ðŸ”° SPECIAL CALL OUT TO YOU: Your work is clear, concise and unambitious. You did well

All the information are perfectly in place, and you've fulfilled all the Project Rubric requirements. This makes it easier for reviewer like me to get things done fast for you.

Here's 3 more great reference sites for you in rounding this nanodegree:

ðŸ“š Lo-fi vs hi-fi wireframes, and the importance of designing the Flows
ðŸ“š UX lo fi
ðŸ“š Prototyping 101: The difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes and when to use each

So a BIG WELL DONE to you

Greetings from
:udacious:

Step 1: Research Synthesis
A link to a Miro board is submitted.

The link has the can comment permission.

The project should be organized logically and neatly.

âœ… Great work in passing this section in your previous submission. Brilliant

The design board has a frame labeled Interview Notes.

The frame should include separate sections of notes for each of the provided interviews. Each respondent should have their own color note card.

The notes should describe the highlights, pains, opportunities, or other observations.

âœ… Great work in passing this section in your previous submission. Brilliant

The design board has a frame labeled Themes and Opportunities (or Interview Synthesis).

The notes from the Interview Notes section are copied to the Interview Synthesis section.

The notes should be grouped and have clearly defined labels representing themes and opportunities

âœ… Great work in passing this section in your previous submission. Brilliant

The design board has a frame labeled Feature Ideation.

The Feature Ideation frame should include at least 10 feature ideas.

The ideas should be self-contained and the notes should contain enough information to communicate what it is.

âœ… Great work in passing this section in your previous submission. Brilliant

The design board has a frame labeled Feature Prioritization.

The Feature Prioritization frame should copy the idea notes from Feature Ideation

The features should be within the realm of development based on the clientâ€™s engineering capacity.

The notes in Feature Prioritization should be organized using one of the following frameworks:

Feature Prioritization Matrix
Value vs Complexity Quadrants
Selected features should be clearly marked using a different colored note. These notes should include text describing the reason the feature is important based on the research.

This is amazing work!

ðŸ“š Value vs Cost and Value vs Complexity

Step 2: Rapid Prototyping
The design board has a frame labeled Paper Sketches - Iteration 1.

The frame should include scans of completed ultra-lo-fi paper sketches. Recall sketching techniques:

Crazy-8s (8 small, rough sketches on a single sheet of paper)
Detail Sketches by drawing your best ideas multiple times.
Layout Sketches to show how everything will fit together on screen.
Each sketch should include a short paragraph text description of the functionality.

Great sketches
âœ… The design board has a frame labeled Paper Sketches - Iteration 1.

REFERENCE MATERIAL
A few great How-To on sketches:
ðŸ“š On How To Sketch Like A Product Designer
ðŸ“š On How to draw New products in 3 steps with this simple creative technique
ðŸ“š On How to Create Technical Drawings of Your Product Idea
ðŸ“š On Use this 5-minute sketch to improve any product or service

The design board has a frame labeled Digital Prototype - Iteration 1.

The frame should include exported images of a wireframe prototype created using Figma.

Each screen should include a short paragraph text description of the functionality.

The prototype should be lo-fidelity and be limited to 3-4 screens.

The prototype should include common UI design patterns like buttons, navigation, and links.

You're spot on
âœ… The design board has a frame labeled Digital Prototype - Iteration 1. This is well done.
Screenshot 2022-09-11 123634.jpg

The Digital Prototype frame should include a URL to the published figma prototype

The prototype should include clickable regions that follow basic UI principals.

You're in the right direction
âœ… The Digital Prototype frame should include a URL to the published Figma prototype.

Step 3: Usability Study and Design Iteration
The design board has a frame labeled Usability Study - Iteration 1.

The frame should include a link to a shared Google Drive.

NOTE: Ensure the link-sharing setting for the folder is set to anyone with link can comment.

The provided Google Drive should include:
A copy of the Usability Guide Template with the completed task section to match your study.
At least one copy of the Usability Guide Template with notes from a session.

You're in the right direction
âœ… The Usability Study frame should include a journey map with each stage broken into smaller tasks.
âœ… Comments from each usability study should be added under each relevant stage. Comments should include things like misunderstandings, pains, frustrations, delights, ideas.
âœ… Selected areas of improvement should be clearly marked using a different colored note. These notes should include text describing the reason the area is important based on the research.

The design board has a frame labeled Iterated Prototype - Iteration 2.

The frame should include exported images of a wireframe prototype created using Figma.

Each screen should include a short paragraph text description of the functionality.

The prototype should be lo-fidelity and be limited to 3-4 screens.

The prototype should include common UI design patterns like buttons, navigation, and links.

The prototype should include changes based on the usability study.
